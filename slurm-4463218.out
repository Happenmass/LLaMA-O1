**Step 1: Find the number of total pictures brought so far.**

   Combined pictures: 7 + 10 + 9 = 26 pictures


**Step 2: Figure out the total photos needed.** 

 Total pictures for filling,  *all with photo-taking equipment* -  already owned means the rest of the photos that are not included on top photos. 40

 Total pictures for filling with equipment + already owns photos are: 40 photos


**Step 3: Account for photos owned already.**


 


 
 
**Step 4: Calculate the remaining photo needed .**


 This equation must solve step 3 - we can figure the photo needed out now.

 **1. First, find the total number of photos provided.**

Their combined photos: 7 + 10 + 9 = 26 photos

**2. Find the number of photos still needed.**

To fully fill the photo album with their contributions, they need to have 40 photos total.

Since they provided  26 photos:

The following  is not clear how you mean to arrive at your final answer. Let me help clarify so this is accurate, so  can the solution to your needs further clarify their needed photos number? 
 

They provided 26 photos, and their needed to have 40 to complete the album, therefore 40- 26 = 14


 Let me know whether you had someone in mind, that might use more of those 26 photos 

 For example:  
* Do you want all photos of the album?
* Or are you interested in a combination that adds up to 40



 
   Would any one of them make that 14?  and clarify who will fill these spots in addition to the first three photos.

**Problem:**
Cristina: 7 pictures
John: 10 pictures
Sarah: 9 pictures
Total: 7, 10, and9 = 26 pictures. The total photo number is how many number slots need to be filled
**Answer in this format:

1. The number of photos missing is ...
2. That number of spots will have to be filled when Clarissa brings ....

 Here is your solution:**

1.**The number of photos missing is (Total photo slots - total photos brought):** 40 - 26 = 14


2. **That number of spots will have to be filled when Clarissa brings...**  Clarissa brings 14 pictures . 





**Explanation:**  The solution breaks the problem down step by step, and solves for the missing total picture amount. Then you need to match them all down to one final total ., Policy: 0.3333282470703125, Value: 0.7316156289466418

1. **Determine the total number of photos brought so far:** 7+10+9 = 26 photos

2. **Calculate the missing numbers.** 40 total- 26brought= 14 photos yet to go inside 

3. **Clarissa's contribution is the final answer.** Each of those **missing pieces needed** need filled  by Clarissa: 14 - 
 
 **Thus : 14 to be brought by Clarissa. **



This solution would go:
Step 1 -> 9(photos that are present).
Step 2->9 + 10 - 26 (already brought. so it takes what is left)
Step 3 ->  clarissa will bring 14-

**Summary:** 

Cristina, John& Sarah want to present their mother a photo album, and Cristina brought 7 photo, John 10 photo and Sarahbrought 9 photos. Then, for photo album, total photo count is 40 slots; so all 4 together  have total of 26 photos ( Cristina 7 + John 10 + Sarah  9 =26), the total amount of photography brought together, they are missing  spots. 

Ultimately there needs  photos from Clarissa.



In order to complete the book, she needs to bring **[** 3 photos $\times$  slots $\div$  Total photo count**]**

 This results in** Clarissa bring** \[ **(14/ 13)=1** ]

**Answers to answer:** [3] . They should bring \[**14 - 2 =** [ (14/12)\]

Let's tackle this with full steps this time:

There are 40 slots available. Together, **Cristina, John, and Sarah have 7 + 10 + 9 = 26 photos**.



To find out how to fulfill the albums (in slots), and we still need those photos *along with* any others to make up for that difference,  *the final answer would still be 40 - 54  photos*

Here is an algorithm we made to calculate the number of photos needed for the photo album :


**Here we are  to calculate what number of photos needs to be taken to fill all 40 slots**.  That number requires subtracting the currently already photo's from the total picture slots 




 
 

The problem gives us a sum of total required to equal 40 as well. Our algorithm would tell that only if you want to reach the 40 slots 



Let's review to see which factors should be fixed and which numbers can be ignored 

Let's find the minimum number (minimum number is 0)

Cristina, John, Clarissa & Sarah want to create a photo album for their mother's birthday. They bring different amounts of pictures:

Cristina brings 7 photos, which leads to 20 photos total with combined of John's 10 and the 
Sarah's 9 photo contributions.
Since they have space in the photo book for 40 photos?  

Clarissa needs to bring in a little less than the albums spaces so the album can be fully constructed. 
 


* I did this.

 **

 ***The summary and drawing a conclusion and final box with the solution: 

Let them know there were 20 photos 
Christina brought 7 photos & John 10 plus Sarah's 9 give  a total of 20 photos.
Clarissa still needs to help if they want complete the album at 40

Id:1->4, Child: *What would make the best answer? Is the reasoning unclear?* 

**Summary:**

The question involves combining the number of photos Clarissa wants to bring and the pictures she brought from the remaining quantity. The combined images needed to get the total picture needs can only be found with her own addition.



\box{ answer:  Clarissa should bring about 11-12 photos to fill up the photo albums to the total spots provided that no overlapping of picture contents exists, and the sum is an estimation or a rounded off range. }




What would make this clearer than just saying we need to understand and how did we get to the final answer

*The way the reasoning is presented could be improved.*  The problem is presented in abstract and not well described enough to understand the intent.

Id:2->4, Child: <h2>Clarissa must bring in [______] picture(s) to complete the photo album.</h2>

Here's a breakdown:

1. You need to figure out what the combined amount of available photos is. 
   * (This involves calculating the totals when John + Crisinta + Sara brings photos to create [combined photos].
  2. You must subtract from the number of total pictures (a count that we didn't have) since they have a limit available [the number of photo album slots].  (a count we didn't use yet. ]
  * In our case (using the original answer the amount  of photos in the album was short.) , we needed at number ( a) that were added together)

The photo album has 40 slots and it requires at mom bring enough photos to fill the slot.


From the problem I was able to gather that there are a total of 26 photos in order to the album to be filled up to 40 or the total photo capacity we need .


Clarissa needs to bring,  pictures because 

 The conclusion is, they need [ * .jpg* ] photos from Clarissa to finish  the album. They are now given 



 This means their photo album will be completely full **if Clarissa brings 14** pictures

Since all of these photos are going into a limited total of 40.  
   The total for all brought up to this point are 7+(John)(total+9= 26 pics; Sarah= 9 pic and John)= 26+ 
   


Clarissa brought into the picture so the remaining spots for that album must be fill by Clarissa's pictures...What is a photo album requires to have to have in order for all images are in the photo album total..
