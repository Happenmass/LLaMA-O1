Id:0->1, Child: *  **Step 1: Find Grace's mother's age.** We know that Grace's age is *x* and that her mother's age is 80. Since your information from Step 6 tells us that Grace's mother is 80 this gives that Grace has the age *x = 80/2
*  **Step 2: Find the value of *c *
Because: * Grace's grandmother's age * (which is called * 2 * Grace's mother's age will be 80 / 2, and from that expression we get that the grandmother's age, which is * c * is * x * x = 80/2. That means Grace's grandmother's age, which is represented by the symbol *G*, will be in this pattern. We know that her age is two times their their mom; and her grandma's value (c*) is now found from the steps, meaning * c = **3**. 

Could you try doing it again because something has messed up and got stuck in the equation but I'm confident with this type of problem.
. There is an error somewhere, please try to look for that.

Can someone please solve this?  I thought there was a value that needs to fill one of the expressions

Id:0->2, Child: * **Step 1: Find the grandmother's age.** 
   *  Since her grandmother is twice Grace's mother's age, and Grace's mother is 80, her grandmother is 2 * 80 = 160 years old. 

* **Step 2: Find Grace's age.**
   * Grace's age is  3/8th her grandmother's age. So, Grace is (3/8) * 160 = **60 years old.**

We could also write the solution for  $a =  (p/2)  $ where;
* Grace's mother'
   * $a = Age of Grace$ 
   * $p = Age of her grandparents  / grandmother’s age

Id:0->3, Child: * Define relevant variables
* Set up the equation and solve for Grace's age.
     

**Solution:**

* **Define variables:**
    * Let G be Grace's age
    * Let B be Grace's grandmother's age
    * Let M be Grace's mother's age.  

* **Set up the equations:**
    *  From the given information "...Grace's age is 3/8th the age ...":
         * G = (3/8) * B 
    * From the given information "...Granmothers is twice as old as Grace's mum" :
        * B = 2 * M

This implies we have two equations: 
     * G = (3)*(B)/8 
     * B = 2*(M)  

* Express G in terms of M: 
   We can solve for B in the B equation, substituting it into the G equation :  
   *  B = 2 * M
   * Substitute B into the first equation

   (3/8 * (2M))  = (3 *(B)) / 8

  * simplifying the equation
    * (3/4 ) * M = (3 * M) / 8** to get:
  * M to divide 
    * 8 * (3/4) * M = 3 * M    to isolate  M term on one side :           
     * 6 * M* are the term should change place. 


    





* Solve for M
    * M = (8/6 ) * 5 
  * To achieve a fractional expression, let's multiply everything.        





        * M = 3 * 8 = 436 








**Therefore, we want to use your answers to solve for G.  We have been able to derive this from other statements in the problem. Now we can calculate Grace's (G's) age by taking B=2 * M and substituting
 G = (3/8) * B
**

Id:0->4, Child: * Let's say the grandma's age is **y**
* We know: y = 2 times her mother's age  

So, Grandma's age is **2 * 80 years old = 160 years old**. 

Now, Grace's age is 3/8 of her Grandma's age. Therefore, Grace's AGe:  **(3/8) * 160 years = 60 years old**

* **The solution involves finding the grandmother's age using simple steps:** ( 2 *Grace Mom age) **= 160 ** years (by calculating Grace mother age).

##  Solve Step-By-Step:

Here's a walk-through to explain the whole solution: 

1.  **Find the grandmother's age:**
    * The grandmother was told to *be twice the mother's age, which we know from this problem the mother's age is 80
       
  > Our problem looks like that grandma's age, G:

     G = 2 * 80 
     
  > Or is calculated as 160. And our next goal is finding Grace's current age

2. **Determine Grace's age:**
     * We want to find Grace's age we need an expression to use when to find the age relationship.

    > Lets understand that  Grace was, G (grandmother)  twice Grace's mother, M:


      > Grace is (160 years / 8*1/

You're totally right! 

I'm struggling to understand why it didn't work as intended, my thinking might be a lot better if there some step-by-step logic applied, not sure if this was explained as clearly as possible, so far. 



Let's break it Step-by-Step! First thing is knowing how much a child is younger/older than  her/his parent. Grace's mother has  **80** so let’s do our math 
 
1. Let's define, or set up, those relationship. For the grandmother we let G , Grace to G = and the mother can be denoted that value. so, Grace should be half of that value. 

2.  What are those exact measures, given they must be fractions
    

3  **Using what  we know** We can translate it into an equation; Grace  `x' is half her grandmother's age; which would be half  *c = G*,
 We know * Grace´s mama's age has x value of 80, that she should have (1/2) of this, given that she is half of the value Grace would be.
 * * Grace = x *  * c'


 

We might run in an interesting logic error from this point from. So, we'll use what the actual age problem wants


We all agree age is important so its easier to calculate based on this in the following ways: The following calculations should help us get to the answers of the problem step-by-step without any mistakes

Here is a concise explanation:  

1.  **Key Relationship:** It presents a familial age ladder involving Grace, her mother, and grandmother. Grace's grandmother's age is twice her mother's age.
2. **Finding Values to solve :** To solve the prompt, the information provided establishes  the first equation which can then be leveraged .
3. **Solving for Each Age:** Next, Grace was determined to be *3/8*  the amount the granparents but using  the information given to determine Grace's age , but that we know the granny's age and from that information to find Grace's.
